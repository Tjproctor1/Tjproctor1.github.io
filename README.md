# About Me

## My Interests

### -Two things that I am very interested in life is music and video games. I took piano lessons as a kid and now play in a band with my older brother. I can play piano, drums, and the bass guitar. We play shows all around Raleigh and it is very fun being able to express ourselves musically. Another thing that I am very passionate about is video games. I have always been in love with them since I got my hands on my first gamecube. 

## Websites I Reccommend

### - (https://www.youtube.com/) - Youtube is such an amazing website becuase it can be so infomrative as well as entertaining. You can learn how to do pretty much anything these days through tutorials on youtube.

### - (https://www.reddit.com/) - Reddit is another website that can be used to find out more information on just about anthing. Its like a modern day, self updating encyclopedia.
